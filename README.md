Heart Attack Prediction Using Machine Learning


🚀 Overview
This project predicts the likelihood of a heart attack based on patient data using machine learning techniques. By leveraging Python and popular libraries, we aim to provide a reliable model that can assist in early detection and intervention.

🧠 Features
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand trends and patterns.
Data preprocessing, including handling missing values and normalization.
Implementation of machine learning algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees).
Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
